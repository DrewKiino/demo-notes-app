## Prompt

Demonstrate your ability to design and develop a basic single-screen iOS notes app using Swift and Firebase for data storage.


Design and implement a simple notes app with the following features:


User Interface: Create a clean and user-friendly single-screen interface where users can enter and view notes.

Note Creation: Allow users to type and save text notes. Each note should have a title and content.

Note Listing: Display a list of saved notes on the same screen, showing the note titles.

Firebase Integration: Use Firebase to store and retrieve notes data. Ensure that notes are stored in the Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.

Editing: Implement functionality to edit existing notes. Users should be able to tap on a note to edit its title and content.

Auto-saving: Ensure that notes are auto-saved in real-time & data is synchronised with Firestore


Deliverables:

A functional notes app with a user-friendly interface.

Firebase integration for data storage and synchronisation.

The ability to create & edit notes.

Real-time synchronisation of notes.

Code that is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
